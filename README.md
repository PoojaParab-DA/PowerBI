### Developing an Interactive Dashboard for KPIs and Performance Analysis at AdventureWorks Using PowerBI


#### Scenerio

You’ve just been hired as a Business Intelligence Analyst by AdventureWorks*, a global
manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories. The management team needs a way to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare
regional performance, analyze product-level trends, and identify high-value customers.
All you’ve been given is a folder of raw csv files, which contain information about
transactions, returns, products, customers, and sales territories. Use Power BI Desktop to:
• Connect and transform the raw data
• Build a relational data model
• Create calculated columns and measures with DAX
• Design an interactive dashboard to visualize the data

#### Steps

2. Data models are configured in the  Model View
3. Table features & calculations are added in the Data View
4. Visuals & reports are designed in the Report View
